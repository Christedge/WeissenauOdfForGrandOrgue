# Weissenau ODF for GrandOrgue

## Overview

[Johann Nepomuk Holzhey](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Nepomuk_Holzhey) was a renowned late baroque organ builder who built about 40 organs, 4 of them with three keybeds. One of the latter can be found at [Weissenau Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weissenau_Abbey). Prospectum [offers a sample set](https://www.prospectum.com/index.php?lang=en&id1=2&id2=9) which is one of my absolute favourites. At the moment, the standard version is available for about 199 €, and IMO it's well worth it.

Currently it is available for [Hauptwerk](https://www.hauptwerk.com), but not for [GrandOrgue](https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue). In this repository you'll find an organ definition file (ODF) and additional files so you can use the sample set Standard 1.0.3. with Grand Orgue.

## Installation

* [Purchase](https://www.prospectum.com/index.php?lang=en&id1=3&id2=0) and install the sample set using Hauptwerk as usual.

* [Download](https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue/releases) and install GrandOrgue (version 3.14 or later is required).

* [Download](https://github.com/Christedge/GrandOrgueFiles/releases/) the files of this repository.

* Locate the folder »000460«. Move the downloaded files adjacent to this folder, resulting in the following structure:

* Ensure your MIDI keyboard is connected to your computer.

* Start GrandOrgue

* Press the key »O« and select the file »Weissenau - Holzhey (1787).organ«. The Weissenau sample set will be loaded.

* Hold the Ctrl key and klick on one of the keybeds. Klick on the button »Wait for Event«, press a key on your keyboard and confirm the dialog.
